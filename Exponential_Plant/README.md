### Problem Statement
Takahashi is growing a plant. Its height at the time of germination is 
0cm. Considering the day of germination as day 
0, its height increases by 
2 
i
 cm day 
i's night 
(0≤i).

Takahashi's height is 
Hcm.

Every morning, Takahashi measures his height against this plant. Find the first day such that the plant's height is strictly greater than Takahashi's height in the morning.
