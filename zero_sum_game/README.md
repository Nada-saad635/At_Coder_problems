# Problem Statement
There are 
N people labeled 
1 to 
N, who have played several one-on-one games without draws. Initially, each person started with 
0 points. In each game, the winner's score increased by 
1 and the loser's score decreased by 
1 (scores can become negative). Determine the final score of person 
N if the final score of person 
i (1≤i≤N−1) is 
A 
i
​
 . It can be shown that the final score of person 
N is uniquely determined regardless of the sequence of games.
